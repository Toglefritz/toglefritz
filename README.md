# Hello, my name is Scott Hatfield

I am a [mobile application developer at Sub-Zero Group](/ScottHatfield_Resume.pdf).

In my free time I work on a wide range of projects. I like to make things and I like to share my work with others. I like to take big, complicated projects, and break them down into simple steps that anybody can understand.

:rocket: [On my projects blog](https://toglefritz.com/) I write about all kinds of projects.

:zap: I've published many projects on [Instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/member/Toglefritz/).

:octocat: I have a lot of my code stored [here on GitHub](https://github.com/Toglefritz).

:nut_and_bolt: [Yet more of my projects](https://maker.pro/profile/scott.hatfield) can be found on Maker Pro.

:mailbox_with_mail: If you'd like to work together, [feel free to reach out](https://hatfieldscott.com/).
